		"description": "My interest in data visualisation drew me to the Facebook API. A lot of data can be extracted from friends status updates and I decided to visualise the words from those status messages. I'm using HTML5 specific features like Web Workers, Session Storage and Progress Bar. The idea is that I will continue to work on the app and add more features. Currently it works best in Chrome, Firefox and IE10. There is currently a bug in IE9 with batch requests to the Facebook API. Since IE8 and earlier does not support SVG the word cloud will not work in those browsers.",
